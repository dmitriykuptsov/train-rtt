\section{Data collection methodology}
\label{section:experiments}

We have used MacBook ability to pick up the GPS coordinates from the iPhone to get the current
position (latitude and longitude), current timestamp from the date utility and mean value
from the batch of 4 ICMP ping requests. For that we have used the following script:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\tiny]
#!/bin/bash

while True;
do
   location=`corelocationcli`
   time=`date +%s`
   p=`ping strangebit.io -c 4 | grep round | awk -F "=" '{print $2}' | awk -F "\/" '{print $2}'`
   echo "$time $location $p" | tee -a m.log
   sleep 4
done
\end{Verbatim}

We have collected a long trace for the entire journey from Helsinki to Tampere, interpolated 
the date using the X method and plotted the results on the map. The source code for the interpolation
is here~\cite{}.
