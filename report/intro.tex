\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

I was always interested in collecting data about latency
and network coverage while traveling on a train. And today I have
got the opportunity to do so. I took the trip from Helsinki to
Rovaniemi by train. The trip is about 9-10 hours long. So I
have decided to take the opportunity to collect such data.

The purpose of this document is not to provide 
a complete map trace of the trip, but rather to show how to use
GPS2IP iOS application and a few simple scripts to
collect the needed data.

As a side note, I should say that the network is amazing
in Finland (compared to other countries I have been to).
