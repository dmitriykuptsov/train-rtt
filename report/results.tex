For the demonstration, we have collected a rather small
trace (30-40 minutes long) for the part of the journey from
Tampere to Rovaniemi. At first, we combined two
measurements using the closest timestamps and created a single log file
(since the GPS and RTT values were stored in two different
files). We then used the plotly library to show the RTT values
on Open Street Map. The results of our effort are shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:results}. The source code of the stuff is here~\cite{git}.
