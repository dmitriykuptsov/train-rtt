\section{Data collection methodology}
\label{section:experiments}

We have used MacBook ability to pick up the GPS coordinates from the iPhone to get the current
position (latitude and longitude), current timestamp from the date utility and mean value
from the batch of 4 ICMP ping requests. For that we have used the following script:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\tiny]
#!/bin/bash

while True;
do
   location=`corelocationcli`
   time=`date +%s`
   p=`ping strangebit.io -c 4 | grep round | awk -F "=" '{print $2}' | awk -F "\/" '{print $2}'`
   echo "$time $location $p" | tee -a m.log
   sleep 4
done
\end{Verbatim}

We have collected a long trace for the entire journey from Helsinki to Tampere. We then interpolated 
the data using the linear interpolator and plotted the results on the map. 
Since the delay between consequtive measurements was 4 seconds we have have interpolated the date using
the following formula: $t \in \{0.1, 0.2, \ldots 1\} x_t = A + (B - A) * t$
The source code of the stuff is here~\cite{git}.
